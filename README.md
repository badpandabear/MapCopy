## What is this? Why is this here?

MapCopy is a Windows/DOS command line tool to copy and edit Civilization 2 saved files.  I originally wrote it in 2000, and then updated it in 2005 when, to my surprise, people were actually using it. So why resurrect a 15 year old project?

1. **Practicality**: I'm looking for a new job and this is the only code project I have to show off that isn't covered under an NDA.
2. **Attachment**: This is the first (only?) personal code project I ever completed. Then it was actually *used by other people!* I'm kinda attached to it and want to see it preserved.
3. **Curiosity**: Resurrecting this project quickly turned to an exercise in personal archaeology. Digging through old files and e-mails I uncovered vanity, abandoned projects, and the surprise of having my code used by others.
4. **Practice**: I want to see if I can update this to C++17, just for the practice. Why not? It has a ready made set of regression tests to use to verify if I've broken anything. *And* i can try to run Windows 98 in a VM! This is what I consider fun.

The original [README.TXT](README.TXT) has more information.
